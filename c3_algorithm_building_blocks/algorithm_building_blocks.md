# Algorithm building blocks

To make things easier to compare and contrast, each algorithm should follow the same template to describe it:

## Name

Descriptive name of the algorithm.

## Input / Output

Expected format of input data to the algorithm and its computed output.

## Context

This step tries to clear these questions:

- Explain the problem that the algorithm tries to solve.
- The algorithm's best case, average and worst case.
- Pseudo code implementation of the algorithm with important notes on properties / features that make the algorithm work correctly.

## Solution

A real code implementation of the algorithm.

## Analysis

- State the algorithm's performance family (big O).
- State calculations / metrics that lead to the conclusion of big O.

## Variations

Present variations of the algorithm or other alternatives. For example, can we implement the algorithm using greedy, divide and conquer or parallel aproach?
